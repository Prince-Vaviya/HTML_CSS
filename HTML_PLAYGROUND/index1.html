This is to showcase that the document content can be displayed on browser without the HTML tags because, Nowadays modern browsers are capable of binding the plain text with the HTML root tags that are required.


If i want to display the content in list format like : 
LINUX
WINDOWS
MAC

they are written one below each other, but why it is displayed on same line, 

Thats why different tags are implemented where in this case list tags comes into handy ...
