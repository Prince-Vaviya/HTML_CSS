1. Difference between padding and margin in CSS

Padding: Adds space inside an element, between its content and its border.

Margin: Adds space outside an element, separating it from other elements. It does not affect the element's size but influences its position on the webpage

Key Difference: Padding is internal spacing; margin is external spacing.
